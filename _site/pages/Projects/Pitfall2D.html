<p>The exercise was to make our own version of the old game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitfall!">Pitfall!</a> <br />
This was a 2D platformer from 1982 about someone named Harry who wanted to go treasure hunting in the jungle. <br /></p>

<h3 id="starting-point">Starting point</h3>
<p>We were given a template to start with. This template was made for 2D pixel games. <br />
Meaning that it was perfect for a game like pitfall. <br />
I myself had little programming knowledge due to being the second project with C++. <br />
But there were enough sources to help me, online and from peers and lecturers.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-did">What I did</h3>
<p>This video shows the gameplay from the final product of 8 weeks work.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: left; align-items: center; gap: 20px; margin: 0 auto;">
<video width="1000" style="margin: -10px 20px 10px 0;" controls="">

<div style="float: right; justify-content: left; align-items: center; gap: 20px; margin: 0 auto;">

<source src="/assets/media/Pitfall2D/LevelScrolling.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
</div>
<p>As seen, there are many features in this game. <br />
The first thing I did was having an <strong>infinite level</strong>, where the scene could go on and on. <br />
Here I even learned that you can move the background instead of moving the player. <br /></p>

<div style="float: left; justify-content: left; align-items: center; gap: 20px; margin: 0 auto;">
<video width="400" style="margin: -10px 20px 10px 0;" controls="" muted="">
<source src="/assets/media/Pitfall2D/Collision.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
</div>
<p><br /><br /><br />
I then tried to implement <strong>collision</strong>, which was harder then I thought.<br />
I calculated the collision by checking which tiles my character is currently touching. <br />
I then could check if of of these tiles was a wall or ground and act upon that. <br />
Later I changed this a bit and used different hit boxes for different parts of the player. 
For example a hitbox for the feet that checks the ground and one for each side that will check for walls, etc. <br />
At this point I also started using my first pointers, how exciting that must be. <br /></p>

<div style="float: left; justify-content: left; align-items: center; gap: 20px; margin: 0 auto;">
<video width="400" style="margin: -10px 20px 10px 0;" controls="" muted="">
<source src="/assets/media/Pitfall2D/Rope.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
</div>
<p>A bonus thing we could add, were <strong>ropes using verlet physics</strong>. I was very intrigued in doing this. <br />
So, I added them. It was a bit scuffed at the beginning, but I like how it turned out. <br />
This is done by having the rope consist of many diffent parts; ‘dots’ I called them. <br />
Using the previous position I could easily calculate the next one. <br />
Then I made sure that the rope is limited by a distance, this is done by calculating the distance for each dot using the pythagoras theorem.
If this distance was too big, I would bring the dot a bit closer to the next dot. <br /></p>

<p>This was not done perfectly at all and the rope could glitch if the velocity is too high. But I was really happy with it at the time.</p>

<p>Next up is the <strong>rewind</strong> feature. This was pretty easy, I just filled an array of 50 positions with the player position. <br />
Every 1 second I would fill 25 positions. When at the last index, I set it back to 0. <br />
When needing to rewind, I would start at the last position I added, and do a full loop.</p>

<p>Finally I added <strong>pixel perfect</strong> collision for certain items like the balloons and coins. <br />
I could overlap 2 different images and check each pixel, if it was a black pixel, it was empty. <br />
When 2 non-empty pixels overlapped, it was a hit. <br /></p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I had fun creating a little game and adding my own touch to it. <br />
Starting this project I had almost no knowledge of C++, this improved a lot during these 8 weeks. <br />
It also helped that I could ask my peers all around me for help, and it was fun seeing what they created. <br />
A great start to the rest of the time I would spend on this study.</p>
