<p><strong>In the second year of my study, I wanted to learn how multiplayer works.</strong> <br />
<strong>I had no idea how this worked and was intrigued in this subject.</strong> <br />
<strong>So, for my self-study project for that block of the year (8 weeks), I choose to make my own networking library.</strong></p>

<h3 id="starting-point">Starting Point</h3>
<p>This started very rough, since I had no knowledge of networking. I did not know what IPs were, what the difference is between UDP and TCP and more. <br />
Meaning, I had to do lots of research to get started. Luckily, there are some good sources on this subject.</p>

<p>Within the span of 8 weeks, I had to create this library, but also make a reference game to show that it works. <br />
I initially wanted to make a crowd control simulator with your friend, but changed ideas and went for a strategy game. <br />
More on the games I made with this later.</p>

<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>Public Connection</strong> <br />
The biggest challenge was getting public connections to work. <br />
After researching about this, I decided to try and connect without a server, meaning a peer to peer connection. <br />
But, this makes it harder to establish a connection. There are multiple ways to do it, but I went with hole punching. <br />
It seemed like the easiest way for both me as programmer and also for the user. <br />
After certain fails, and figuring out that the school’s network is way more secure, I got the public connection to work.</p>

<p><strong>Debugging</strong> <br />
Many errors were encountered in the making of this project, and those had to be solved. <br />
After some time I noticed that debugging with 2 different programs is almost 2 times as hard. <br />
You have to look both on the sending and the receiving end of the program, which makes it difficult.</p>

<h3 id="games">Games</h3>
<p>I made some unfinished games with this library.</p>

<p><strong>Pong</strong> <br />
I quickly made a small pong game, which is nothing out of the ordinary:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: left; align-items: center; gap: 20px; margin: 0 auto;">
<video width="1000" style="margin: -10px 20px 10px 0;" controls="">
<source src="../../assets/media/PongGame.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
</div>

<p><strong>Stategy</strong> <br />
During the 8 weeks I made this strategy game to showcase the possibilities of my library. 
The game is about conquering bases of other players.  <br />
I also learned some things while making this game, for example stencil shading and a lot about ImGui. <br />
In this video I play as one player (green), while on my other screen I also play as player 2 (red).</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: left; align-items: center; gap: 20px; margin: 0 auto;">
<video width="1000" style="margin: -10px 20px 10px 0;" controls="">
<source src="../../assets/media/StategyNetworkGame.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
</div>

<p><strong>2D shooter</strong>
In my free time I also made a 2D shooter using this library.
This was further in the production, yet, still not finished. <br />
For this game I used box2D to get my physics to work. <br /></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: left; align-items: center; gap: 20px; margin: 0 auto;">
<video width="800" style="margin: -10px 20px 10px 0;" controls="">
<source src="../../assets/media/NetworkingDiaDenstra.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
</div>

<p><strong>Blender (W.I.P.)</strong>
Currently for my year 3, first block, I am making Blender multiplayer. <br />
I have not seen instances of this being done using Blender’s source code, so there was a lot to discover.<br />
More about this in my (soon) blender blog/project. <br />
The weird shading on the newly created cubes is due to normals not being updated correctly.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: left; align-items: center; gap: 20px; margin: 0 auto;">
<video width="800" style="margin: -10px 20px 10px 0;" controls="">
<source src="../../assets/media/CreateStandardCube.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
</div>

<h3 id="improvements">Improvements</h3>
<p>With the integration of the library into Blender, I had some oppertunity to improve my library. <br />
This was very nice, since the library had many issues which I now could resolve. <br />
Currently it still has issues, for example it only supports for UDP, yet for Blender, TCP would be much nicer. <br />
These improvements I could make in the future when I need them. <br />
But this is how far my networking library is at the moment.</p>
