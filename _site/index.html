<p>My name is Finn Thiesen, I am 19 years old.<br />
I am currently studying C++ programming at the BUAS in Breda as a year 3. <br /></p>

<p>This website is currently for my school.<br />
Things like blogs about programming will be posted here.</p>

<h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>
<p>I started programming on scratch since the start of high school. <br />
This I enjoyed very much, just to create random games very easily. <br />
Its only in the 4th and 5th grade of high school that I started programming a bit more in computer science. <br />
I decided to go to BUAS as my study. For this I had to make an intake game. <br />
This took some time, since it was my first time diving deep into C++. <br />
But I succeeded and got into the study. <br />
Since then I kept programming during school and also during my freetime. <br />
I love to combine my hobby of meteorology with programming and create handy features I could use. <br /></p>
