My name is Finn Thiesen, I am 19 years old.<br>
I am currently studying <strong style="color:black;"><u>C++</u></strong> programming at the BUAS in Breda as a year 3. <br>
This personal website contains information about my programming career. 
This includes blogs and projects I created.

I worked on many interesting projects, such as <strong style="color:black;"><u>networking</u></strong>, <strong style="color:black;"><u>2D and 3D Pitfall</u></strong> and a real-time <strong style="color:black;"><u>weather simulation</u></strong>

### Experience
I started programming on scratch since the start of high school. <br>
This I enjoyed very much, just to create random games very easily. <br>
Its only in the 4th and 5th grade of high school that I started programming a bit more in computer science. <br>
I decided to go to BUAS as my study. For this I had to make an intake game. <br>
This took some time, since it was my first time diving deep into <strong style="color:black;"><u>C++</u></strong>. <br>
But I succeeded and got into the study. <br>
Since then I kept programming during school and also during my freetime. <br>
Now I am a <strong style="color:black;"><u>general programmer</u></strong> and love to do many different things. <br>
I love to combine my hobby of <strong style="color:black;"><u>meteorology</u></strong> with programming and create handy features I could use. <br>
