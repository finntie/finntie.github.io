# About me

My name is Finn Thiesen, I am 19 years old.<br>
I am currently studying C++ programming at the BUAS in Breda as a year 3. <br>

This website is currently for my school.<br>
Things like blogs about programming will be posted here.

### Experience
I started programming on scratch since the start of high school. <br>
This I enjoyed very much, just to create random games very easily. <br>
Its only in the 4th and 5th grade of high school that I started programming a bit more in computer science. <br>
I decided to go to BUAS as my study. For this I had to make an intake game. <br>
This took some time, since it was my first time diving deep into C++. <br>
But I succeeded and got into the study. <br>
Since then I kept programming during school and also during my freetime. <br>
I love to combine my hobby of meteorology with programming and create handy features I could use. <br>
